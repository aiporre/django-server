<p>This project just is an example of implementing a web server that uses a machine learning model. In this case, we choose the generative adversarial network model that generates faces. The app just gets random faces from an end-point connected that runs the Style-GAN from NVIDIA from <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan">this repository.</a></p>
